# PHP-Login-Signup-System-Preset
This is my Preset PHP code which will help future Web-developers, It's a Login-Signup System for everyone to use
It has my files for those struggling or learning PHP, MySQL, etc

# Also make sure you use WAMP64 or XAMPP for the Server (Locally hosted) and the Database (PhpMyAdmin)
### Here you can get XAMPP and WAMP
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/

Keep in mind that XAMPP is recommended for Mac and Linux users, whereas WAMP is for windows only, both have the same functionality, except WAMP doesn't support Perl
## And make sure you have atleast understanding of how MySQL, PHP and HTML works
## Also feedback would be nice, thank you
